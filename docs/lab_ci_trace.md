## lab ci trace

Trace the output of a ci job

### Synopsis

Download the CI pipeline job artifacts for the given or current branch if
none provided. If a job is not specified the latest running job or last
job in the pipeline is used

The branch name, when using with the --merge-request option, can be the
merge request number, which matches the branch name internally.	The "job"
portion is the given job name, which may contain whitespace characters
and which, for this specific case, must be quoted.

```
lab ci trace [remote] [branch][:job] [flags]
